UAV

UAV is a small JavaScript utility for templates with one-way data binding.

Install

npm install uav or yarn add uav

Creating a Model

uav.model(model)

Arguments:

model: an object to be used as the view model.
Returns: An object with the same properties as model. When a property on this object is changed, any template expressions which reference it will be reevaluated and, if necessary, rendered.

const model = uav.model({
    text: 'hello, world!'
});
Creating a Component

uav.component([model], template, [selector], [callback])

Arguments:

model: A model created with uav.model(). Optional.
template: A template string.
selector: A CSS selector indicating a parent element in which to render this component. Optional.
callback: A function to call after the initial render. Passed the component's top-level DOM element. Optional.
Returns: The model.

const component = uav.component(model, `
    <h1>{text}</h1>
`);
Template Expressions

Expressions are best explained by example:

Basic expression:

`<div>This is a content expression: {content}</div>`
Attribute expression:

`<div class="wrapper {visible}"></div>`
If an attribute expression evaluates to a boolean, it will render nothing if false, or the property name if true. This makes toggling the "visible" class on the above <div> as easy as model.visble = !model.visible.

Event expression:

`<div onclick="{click}"></div>`
Any template expression which evaluates to a function is assumed to be an event handler, and will be passed the event object.

Array loop expression:

`<ul loop="items" as="item,index">
    <li>{item}</li>
</ul>`
Add the loop and as attributes to an element to repeat its content for each item in an array.

Object loop expression:

`<ul loop="object" as="value,key">
    <li>{key} = {value}</li>
</ul>`
Child Components

Components can be rendered into other components by adding them to the model and referencing them as HTML tags.

const child = uav.component('<div>I am a child.</div>');

const model = uav.model({
    child
});

uav.component(model, `
    <div>
        This is a component with a child.
        <child></child>
    </div>
`, '#app');
This will render the following into the #app component:

<div>
    This is a component with a child.
    <div>I am a child.</div>
</div>
Passing Data to Children

function child(data) {

    const childModel = uav.model({ data });

    return uav.component(childModel, `<div>{data}</div>`);
}

const model = uav.model({
    child: child('This is passed from parent to child.')
});

uav.component(model, `
    <div>
        This component passes data to its child.
        <child></child>
    </div>
`);
This will render the following into the #app component:

<div>
    This component passes data to its child.
    <div>This is passed from parent to child.</div>
</div>
Special Attributes

data-src

Imagine that an image source is bound to a template expression:

uav.component('<img src="{imageSource}" />');

To prevent your browser from making a request to /{imageSource} before your JavaSrcript runs, you can use the data-src attribute.

uav.component('<img data-src="{imageSource}" />');

data-style

Internet Explorer can be extremely picky about the value of an inline style tag. A template expression like the following will work in any browser except IE:

uav.component('<div style="left: {left}px"></div>');

To support Internet Explorer, you can use the data-style attribute instead:

uav.component('<div data-style="left: {left}px"></div>');

DOM Access

Data-bound templates generally supplant the need to perform any manual DOM manipulation. However, there are occasions where it is unavoidable. Elements can be accessed by passing a selector (and optionally, a callback) to the uav function.

Access the first matched element:

uav('.item').classList.toggle('visible');

Access all matched elements by passing a callback:

uav('.item', item => item.classList.toggle('visible'));

Collapsing Whitespace

Using multiline template strings creates unnecessary whitespace in your javascript files. To collapse whitespace, add a step like this to your build process:

tr -s " " < dist/bundle.js > dist/tmp && mv dist/tmp dist/bundle.js
